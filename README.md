# Isolated disk galaxy initializer

Python module to create initial conditions for an isolated disk galaxy simulation:
* Density and rotation curve of a **gaseous disk in hydrostatic equilibrium** are computed using the potential method of Wang et al., MNRAS 407 (2010).
* The computation of particle initial conditions for a **dark matter halo with NFW or Hernquist density profile** is based on the method of Drakos et al., MNRAS 468 (2017).

## Installation

Copy ```halo.py``` (base class) and ```gasdisk.py``` (subclass) to your work directory and import the module:

```
import gasdisk
```
